# Rules

The members on this server and the members of the associated servers must follow the 
Discord Terms of Service (dis.gd/terms) and the Discord Community Guidelines (dis.gd/guidelines). Any violation of any of these will result immediate and permanent expulsion. In some cases this will also mean a potential report to Discord.

Although the server does not have any additional rules, members should use common sense, and any behavior that the moderators deem inappropriate may result in a penalty.

**a.** The Guild Confederation has 4 official languages: English, German, Italian and Spanish.
These are the the only languages accepted for chats on the server, for moderation purposes. However, if a server meets the requirements to be a member of the Confederation, the use or not of the official languages will not exclude them.

**b.** The process of joining the Confederation must be carried following the specified format. If it does not meet the standards, the application will be rejected.

**c.** The membership application may be rejected for the following reasons:

- The server does not comply with the Terms of Service or the Community Guidelines.
- The server has less than 20 members.
- The server has less than 12% active members.
- The server has security failures or is not well configured.
- The server has been part of the Confederation and has been expelled for some other reason.

**d.** The Federal Council is the main administrative body of the Confederation. Its function is to review the membership applications and vote if they are accepted or not. Its members are elected monthly in elections held on the Confederation server, or, if more convenient, on the member server with the most users.

**e.** The mandate of each council lasts one month. For example, if a new council is elected at the end of December, it will take office on January 1 and transition to the next elected council on February 1.

**f.** The members of the Federal Council can stand for re-election without a term limit, but not consecutively, so there must be at least one council of which they are not a part before returning to govern.

**g.** The elections to the Council that will take office the following month will be held on the 15th of each month, giving users who want to appear until the 10th to announce their candidacy for the elections. Until this day, a channel will be enabled where they can present their candidacy and their proposals.
